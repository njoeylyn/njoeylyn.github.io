### CPSC 120

* [Lab 4](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2024/cpsc-120-lab-04-sopheakca-niobe_lab4/tree/main/part-2)

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite lab of mine due to the nature of the game as well as the code. If-statements are a favorite function of mine and utilizing them for a game such as "Hi-Lo" was particularily fun as well as interesting as I got to use If-Statements in a new way. 

* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2024/cpsc-120-lab-07-hannah-and-niobe/tree/main/part-1) 

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite lab of mine because I really enjoyed having to cross reference what I was coding with the images that were provided. It was fun and a good learning experience as well as satisfying to see the arguments we provided get validated. Working with command line arguments did prove to be difficult, however, the learing experiencE was satisfying and rewarding in the end.


* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2024/cpsc-120-lab-12-niobe_katelyn_lab12/tree/main/part-1) 

    Lab 12 was a favorite lab of mine because I really enjoyed creating the animated gradient and seeing how the red, green, and blue channels combined into a smooth animation. It was satisfying to use sine calculations and lookup tables to produce the desired output while testing and debugging the program. Although working with the command line arguments and GraphicsMagick had its challenges, the learning experience was rewarding in the end.
